    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Video gaming has become one of the most popular forms of entertainment worldwide, with millions of players engaging across various platforms and genres. For game developers and publishers, understanding player engagement is crucial for building lasting relationships with their audience. One key metric of player engagement is newsletter subscription, which indicates a player's interest in staying connected with the game community and receiving updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we aim to answer the following research question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?**\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, can factors such as `Age` and `played_hours` predict newsletter subscription in the players dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is significant because understanding subscription behavior can help game developers:\n",
    "- Target marketing efforts more effectively\n",
    "- Identify engaged players for community building\n",
    "- Improve player retention strategies\n",
    "- Personalize communication with different player segments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses the dataset `players.csv` which contains information about individual players. The data was collected by the research group at [PlaiCraft.ai](https://plaicraft.ai), a platform studying player behavior in gaming environments.\n",

    "**Dataset characteristics:**\n",
    "- **Number of observations:** 196\n",
    "- **Number of variables:** 7\n",
    "\n",
    "The response variable `subscribe` indicates whether a player subscribes to the newsletter, while our primary predictors are `Age` and `played_hours`. Identifiers like `name` and `hashedEmail` are excluded as they are not relevant for prediction. Based on exploratory analysis, `gender` and `experience` showed little effect on subscription rates and will not be used as predictors."
